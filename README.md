# 💫 About Me

## Hi there 👋 I’m Muhammad Patel

I am an **entry-level Software Developer** with hands-on experience in building **frontend, backend, and full stack web applications** using modern JavaScript technologies. I focus on writing clean, readable code, understanding application flow, and continuously improving my development skills through real-world projects.

### 👨‍💻 About Me

I enjoy working on practical problems and converting requirements into structured, working features. I have experience building applications that involve user authentication, role-based access, CRUD operations, and API integration. My learning approach is project-driven, where I focus on understanding both the **why** and the **how** behind implementation decisions.

I am actively seeking **entry-level or junior roles** where I can learn from experienced developers, contribute to real products, and grow as a software engineer.
